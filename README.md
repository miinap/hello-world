A place for testing new things

I'm studying sales and visual marketing at Haaga-Helia UAS.
This spring I'm taking the Applied Coding 1 course. The course is an introduction to coding. 
I'm going to learn some basics about HTML, JavaScript, Python and R-code. 
Here I'm going to post some exercises I do during the course.
